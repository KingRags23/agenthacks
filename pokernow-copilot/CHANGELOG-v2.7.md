# PokerNow GTO Copilot v2.7 - UI Cleanup

## üóëÔ∏è **Removed: Useless Confidence Badge**

### What's Removed

**Confidence Badge** - Removed the confidence percentage badge that displayed next to the recommended action header since it was deemed unnecessary clutter.

### Changes Made

‚úÖ **Cleaner UI**: 
- Removed confidence badge from advice header
- Simplified header to just show "RECOMMENDED ACTION"
- Removed all confidence badge styling and animations

‚úÖ **Code Cleanup**:
- Removed `confidence-badge` and `confidence-level` HTML elements
- Removed all CSS styling for confidence components
- Cleaned up JavaScript references to confidence elements
- Removed confidence badge animations and background color updates

‚úÖ **Preserved Functionality**:
- Confidence information is still calculated internally
- Percentages still shown in primary action display
- Strategy frequencies remain visible with Monte Carlo variation

### Impact

- **Cleaner Interface**: Less visual clutter in the copilot header
- **Better Focus**: Users can focus on the actual recommendation
- **Faster Rendering**: Slightly less DOM elements to update
- **Maintained Data**: All confidence calculations still work behind the scenes

### Files Modified
- `js/copilot-ui.js` - Removed confidence badge HTML, JS references, and updates
- `css/copilot.css` - Removed confidence badge styling

The confidence information is still available in the detailed analysis and strategy frequencies, but the redundant badge is gone for a cleaner experience.

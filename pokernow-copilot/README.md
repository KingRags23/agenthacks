## üéì Poker Theory Background

### Game Theory Optimal (GTO) Play

GTO poker strategy aims to create an unexploitable playing style by using mathematical principles to make optimal decisions. Key concepts include:

- **Nash Equilibrium** - Balanced strategy where no player can improve by changing
- **Mixed Strategies** - Randomizing between actions with optimal frequencies
- **Range Construction** - Playing hands based on position and action
- **Bet Sizing** - Using mathematically sound bet sizes for value and bluffs

### Equity and Odds

Understanding poker math is crucial for GTO play:

- **Pot Equity** - Your percentage chance of winning the pot
- **Pot Odds** - Ratio of bet size to total pot size
- **Implied Odds** - Future betting considerations
- **Fold Equity** - Additional value from opponent folds

### Position and Ranges

Position is fundamental in poker strategy:

- **Early Position** - Tighter ranges, more value-focused
- **Late Position** - Wider ranges, more aggressive play
- **Button Play** - Maximum positional advantage
- **Blind Defense** - Pot odds considerations from big blind
